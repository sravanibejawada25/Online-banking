  <p style="font:"Times New Roman", Times, serif"><h2><b>Important security information:</b></h2>
-Before logging in,please ensure that the URL address on the addres bar of your internet browser starts with https://infinity.onlinebanking.com.<br/>
  -Never provide your User ID or password to any one on phone or in response to a mail.Report a suspicious mail.<br/>
  -Do not enter login or other sensitive information in any pop up window.<br/>
  -Verify the site's security certificate by clicking on the padlock icon of your internet browser.<br/></p>
  
 
  
 <p style="font:'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><h3><b>Important Security Notice</b></h3>
 
- Check for the "Lock" icon. There is a de facto standard among web browsers to display a "lock" icon somewhere in the window of the browser (NOT in  the web page display area!).<br />
- ONLINE BANKING does not ask you for any personal information other than your user ID and password when you log into www.onlinebanking.com.<br /> 
- ONLINE BANKING will never send e-mails that ask for confidential information. If you receive an e-mail requesting your Internet Banking security  like PIN, password or account number, you should not respond and forward the e-mail to antiphishing@onlinebanking.com.<br />
- Be cautious about any unsolicited offers or opportunities offering you the chance to make some easy money. These adverts will normally state that  they are an overseas company seeking "representatives" or "agents" to act on their behalf for a period of time, sometimes to avoid high charges for  making payments, or local taxes.<br />
- Check the webpage's URL. When browsing the web, the URLs (web page addresses) begin with the letters "http". However, over a secure connection, the  address displayed should begin with "https" - note the "s" at the end. For example: Our home page address is http://www.onlinebanking.com. Here the  URL begins with "http" meaning this page is not secure and there is no account or personal information stored or asked. Click the tab under "Login".  The URL now begins with "https”, meaning the user name and password typed in will be encrypted before being sent to our server.<br />
- Avoid accessing your Internet Banking account from a cyber cafe.<br />
- Your password should be complex and difficult for others to guess. Use letters, numbers and special characters [such as !,@, #,$, %, ^, &,* (, )] in  your passwords.<br /></p>
